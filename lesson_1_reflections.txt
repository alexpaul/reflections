Working with the diff command was somewhat cumbersome
Viewing longer files would be very difficult to debug

Having version history is very efficient and essential to a programmer. 
Version control saves time esp. in larger dev teams. Even if you're a 
solo developer Version Control is a must do 

Being subjective with when to commit can be a disadvantage to the overall
version control method since what may seem right to you to commit at that time
may be a regret at some later time when you are looking over versions.
The advantage in manually committing is you know exactly when you're doing the 
process. 

Git allows saving files multiple files because it's more geared to full stack 
development as opposed to Google Docs, etc 

You can use git log along with git diff to compare differences between versions and 
what was added and deleted.

My confidence is breaking code and reverting and fixing bugs using git is improving

I am planning to use git forward in all my development work
