Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
You may not always want this scenario because not all changes you want to implement ncessarily locally 

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote respository is an excellent way to share and colloborate and also has the benefit of 
being an excellent backup.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks exist only in the Github environment. Its the equivalent of cloning but only on the Github platform. You
make a clone/ copy of a repo locally or from remote to local. A branch occurs on a single repo. It represents 
the current label of a set of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a local remote updated lets you keep track of your sync status. 
For offline work this is very beneficial as well.  

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/Github collaboration could be done using email or Google Docs. 
Git/Github is definetely easier since it's a platform build exactly for version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?
Mostly when a new feature is being tried or bug fix.
